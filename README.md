- Implementing [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and refactoring database to [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- Reviewing code quality to identify areas where readability, accessibility, and usability could be improved.
- Implementing unit, integration, and E2E testing using [JestJS](https://jestjs.io/), [Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) and back-end with [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
